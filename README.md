>I was born and raised in the rhythm-and-hustle of Washington, D.C.—a city alive with urgency, identity, connection. From an early age I found myself drawn not just to people, but to systems: what makes things work, how things connect, how information flows. While other kids might be out kicking a ball, I was peering into the back of a computer or wondering what route a packet takes when I click “send.” It wasn’t just fascination—it was inevitability.

>In high school I discovered two truths: first, that I could speak more than one way (I picked up French and Spanish), and second, that tech and identity were not separate lanes—they were converging tracks. My multilingual growth taught me that language is system and culture just as much as grammar and verbs. My love of gaming, dance, and the LGBTQ+ community taught me that systems include the human heart. I didn’t want to be one facet—they could all exist in tandem.

>Then came university (Bowie State University) where the technical came into sharper focus: routing, switching, infrastructure, the backbone of networks. At the same time I never lost sight of the “why”—why infrastructure matters, why media and networks power stories, why identity and community matter. I learned that being “intelligent, technically competent and can do — professional, anytime, anywhere…” isn’t just a tagline. It became my motto.

>Landing a role at NBCUniversal as a Systems & Network Engineer was a milestone—not just for career, but for purpose. Here I wasn’t just keeping systems live; I was enabling storytellers, enabling connection across screens, devices, geographies. The media industry moves fast. The stakes are high. Systems have to be reliable, agile, resilient. That’s my world. My gamer’s mindset helps when things go sideways (“okay, one more try”), my dancing rhythm helps when I need to find balance in chaos, and my multilingual, multimedia identity helps me see the ecosystem as interconnected.

>Outside of “the 9-to-?” I keep the creative fire alive. Gaming isn’t just escape—it sharpens strategy, reaction, teamwork. Dancing isn’t just movement—it reminds me bodies, circuits, networks all move when engaged. I'm active in the LGBTQ+ space because being seen, being authentic, matters as much as any network cable. I stream, I build, I express, and I refuse to check any part of myself at the door.

>So what’s next? I’m pushing forward. Maybe I move into larger-scale architecture, maybe cloud, maybe I lead teams, build bridges between tech & creativity. Whatever comes, I’ll keep the same through-line: curiosity always, authenticity always, the question of “how can this work better, more human, more connected” always.

>Because one thing I’ve learned: Wires are cold until you bring meaning. Networks are invisible until you use them to speak, to create. And identity isn’t a side note—it’s part of the system. I’m here to engineer the infrastructure *and* the culture. I’m here to dance when the beats hit, to route packets when the alarms go off, and to smile at the fact that yes, all these things—tech, identity, rhythm, voice—can belong to the same person.
